Proven expertise in designing, implementing, and managing end-to-end CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Argo CD. Architected and deployed secure, high-performance, and fault-tolerant cloud solutions on AWS, leading to a 40% reduction in operational overhead. Proficient in a comprehensive DevOps toolkit including Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and observability platforms like Prometheus and Grafana. AWS Certified (SAA-C03) with a strong commitment to automation and operational excellence. Work Experience Senior Software Engineer Everstek Technosoft Solutions | July 2024 - Present Designed, built, and maintained a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Jenkinsfile to automate build, test, and deployment stages for a microservices architecture on AWS EKS, resulting in a 75% reduction in deployment time and enabling over 20 daily production releases with zero downtime. Spearheaded the adoption of a GitOps workflow with Argo CD, managing over 50 applications and services. Automated and synchronized application deployments across development, staging, and production environments, leading to a 40% improvement in release consistency and reliability. Managed and optimized cloud infrastructure on AWS, including services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS, using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform. This ensured scalable, cost-effective, and reproducible environments and reduced infrastructure provisioning time by 60%. Established and configured comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization, providing real-time insights into application performance and infrastructure health. This proactive approach decreased incident resolution time by 50%. Automated infrastructure provisioning and configuration management with Ansible, creating playbooks to deploy and manage software on both EC2 and on-premise servers. This eliminated manual errors and reduced setup time for new services from hours to minutes. Developed and maintained automation scripts in Bash and Python to streamline routine operational tasks, from log rotation to database backups, enhancing team productivity and efficiency by 30%. Senior Software Engineer Everstek Technosoft Solutions | Nov 2021 - July 2024 Architected, deployed, and managed a secure, enterprise-grade ML Sandbox Environment on AWS using Terraform to handle sensitive customer PII, ensuring strict privacy and compliance standards for a major InsureTech enterprise. Led the implementation of a Generative AI document processing service with a team of five, leveraging AWS Lambda, Bedrock, Textract, and SageMaker. This system processed over 100,000 documents daily with 98% accuracy, cutting manual review time by 85%. Developed and maintained a high-throughput FinTech platform on AWS using a modern stack (ECS, RDS, OpenSearch). This platform supported over 1,000 active daily users and maintained 99.99% uptime. Engineered an event-driven processing system using AWS SQS and Lambda to handle over 5,000 concurrent messages per minute with sub-second latency, enabling rapid and scalable feature development. Modernized legacy healthcare APIs using FastAPI, which doubled response speed and reduced cloud costs by 40% through efficient architecture. Spearheaded a technical Proof of Concept (POC) for a high-throughput event-driven architecture, successfully propagating bus tracking updates with sub-second latency across environments using CI/CD pipelines. Improved deployment consistency and reduced infrastructure provisioning time by 60% by implementing multi-environment Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. Optimized cloud infrastructure costs by 35% through strategic resource allocation and the implementation of auto-scaling policies across AWS services, demonstrating a strong focus on cost management. Enhanced the OpenSearch logging pipeline by implementing lifecycle policies, resulting in a 30% reduction in storage costs and improving data retention efficiency. Conducted security assessments and remediated vulnerabilities within the AWS infrastructure to maintain a secure and compliant environment. Demonstrated technical expertise across all project phases, from deploying containerized infrastructure with Terraform and designing APIs, to implementing efficient database schemas and developing scalable microservices. Developed and deployed microservices for an EdTech Portal Admin Panel dashboard, building RESTful APIs that adhered to industry best practices and actively participating in Agile ceremonies.
